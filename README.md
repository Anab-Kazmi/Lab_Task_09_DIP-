Prompt

Write a Python program using OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform comprehensive color image processing. The program should:
1. Allow the user to upload any image (Colab-safe).
2. Load the image, convert it to RGB, and display both the original and grayscale versions side by side.
3. Extract and display the Red, Green, and Blue channels individually.
4. Convert the RGB image to HSV, YCbCr, and Lab color spaces and display each color space.
5. Apply white balance correction using the Gray World assumption and display the corrected image alongside the original.
6. Perform color masking to isolate a specific color (e.g., green) using the HSV color space, and display the original, the mask, and the masked image.
7. Perform simple segmentation on the Lab 'a' channel using thresholding, and display the original image, the HSV masked image, and the Lab 'a' channel segmented image side by side.
8. Ensure all plots are properly labeled, with axes turned off, and figures sized appropriately for clear visualization.
